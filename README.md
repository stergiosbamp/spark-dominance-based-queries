# scalable-dominance-based-queries
This is the repository for the Big Data course project.

## Task
Design and implement distributed algorithms for processing of dominance-based queries that can scale to large amount of data and multiple machines.

* Stergios Bampakis

## Dataset
We will generate multidimensional synthetic datasets that follow a correlated, uniform, normal, and anticorrelated distribution. Each type of distribution poses a different level of difficulty for the algorithms.

### Project setup

#### Generating the synthetic datasets
Create virtual environment

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Upgrade pip

```
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install dependencies

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Applying the algorithms
To be completed soon.
