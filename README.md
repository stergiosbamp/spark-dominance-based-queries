# Dominance-based queries on Apache Spark.

Skyline queries are a popular and powerful paradigm for extracting interesting objects from a multi-dimensional dataset. Given a set D of d-dimensional objects (or points), the skyline set of R is the set of Pareto-optimal, or undominated, points in D

## Algorithms

1. Skyline query based on the Sort Filter Skyline (SFS) algorithm.

2. Top-k dominating based on the Skyline-based Top-k Dominating (STD).

3. Top-k dominating on Skyline

## Datasets

There are 4 distributions of synthetic datasets to run the algorithms, from 2-d to 10-d.

1. Correlated
2. Uniform
3. Normal
4. Anti-correlated
